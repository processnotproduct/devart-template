We have been hard at work with the code and hardware, but I wanted to update you on the physical instrument itself.

Our project started because we wanted to create a different way to interact with sounds and light. Keyboards and drum machines are usually sterile and hard.

We thought that spheres filled with pressure feel different and so we started exploring how we could measure that air pressure and what type of instrument and interactive space could you create with that idea.

In this image we began to cut out the holes needed to contain the spheres(kids rubber bouncy balls ... fast prototyping right!). We used a router with a 5/8 curvature to get this shape.

That was then replicated on another partical board that sits on top of the ball.

Here you can see 2 different models, small and large. We invision the actual space to be filled with these types of instruments that actually take a more organic feel to the structure. We also would want to see very large spheres on the ground and also suspended from above.

Here we are prototyping the sensors and how they will be connected to the controllers. We are using Arduino now but could use other controllers in a large scale installation.

We then constructed the cabinets for the instrument. We wanted to incorperate an esthetique into the cabinet that added to the overall apperence of it. I'd like to say I used some facny algorithm to come up with these designs but really I just drew it out right on the material ... literally connecting the dots.

Here you can see a foam tape that I used to further contain and cushion the spheres.

This is what the front looks like lit up! We think it would be awesome to be immersed in the space with only the light from these types of displays and the spheres shinning in the darkness.
