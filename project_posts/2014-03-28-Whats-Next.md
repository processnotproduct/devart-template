We are thinking of what the space will look and feel like.

Heres one quick sketch that shows a general idea. Of course we would like this sketch to look awesome and polished but sometimes all you have is a tablet and a finger.
![Example Image](../project_images/000DevArtSketch.png?raw=true "Drawing!")

We have more work to do like:
  - Get new sensors!
  - Create a shader/s
  - Include Glass video feed into shader?!
  - Make awesome sounds!
  - Package up the whole thing into a Chrome Packaged App
  - Design the over all space
  - Drink MOAR! coffee!!!
  - Design more control pads and structure along with the lit designs on them
  - Find a way to bluetooth the sensor and stick it inside the spheres so some can just be bounced around the space!
  - Do awesome stuff!

We are excited to see where this idea can go! Maybe the Flaming Lips or Skillex will want a setup made ... who knows!

Have fun DevArters and never stop being awesome!
