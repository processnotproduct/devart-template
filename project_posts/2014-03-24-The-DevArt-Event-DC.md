On March 24th we attended a GDG DevArt Event in D.C. in which we exhibited, demonstrated, and gave a talk on the idea of DevArt and the technologies we used to create our project.

The venue was ArtJamz an awesome place for art, mostly because as you can see from these pictures. you can splatter paint every where. They were great hosts and let us really take over their space for the evening.

We had about 55 people that attended and a lot of great question, comments and conversation came out of this. I think this mostly because this was something different than the normal events in the area.

Many people wanted to know about the technology but many others just wanted to play with it!

There was a reception with food and drinks!

Many Glass Explorers were also there giving demos! One of our grander ideas is to incorperate the video feed from glass into a shader like "BadTV" then project that. The players viewpoint would be recorded for upload to youtube if they wish.
